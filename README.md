## 🧠 About Me

I’m a highly experienced IT professional with 30+ years of hands-on success in
technical consulting, software development, and solution architecture — with a
specialty in **merchandise planning** and **enterprise integrations**. My
journey has spanned roles from software engineer to senior architect, with a
deep focus on delivering scalable, high-impact solutions in the **retail,
grocery, and fashion** industries.

I’ve led multi-disciplinary teams, designed large-scale enterprise applications,
mentored technical staff, and created tools that accelerate delivery and improve
client success. Whether working on-site or remotely, I bring strategic vision,
technical depth, and a customer-first mindset.
