## 🧠 About Me

I’m a results-driven IT professional with over 30 years of experience spanning software architecture, technical leadership, and implementation consulting. My expertise lies in designing and delivering large-scale, enterprise-grade applications — with a deep focus on merchandise planning and Blue Yonder SaaS-based Enterprise Planning implementations across the retail, grocery, and fashion industries.

Throughout my career, I’ve led cross-functional teams, mentored developers, resolved high-visibility escalations, and driven technical process improvements that enhance both system performance and customer satisfaction. I bring a builder’s mindset to every project: breaking down complex challenges and delivering efficient, scalable solutions.

Currently, I’m focused on expanding into data engineering, Python-based automation, and modern cloud platforms like Azure and Snowflake — with a goal of bridging legacy expertise and future-ready architecture.

Fun fact: In my spare time, I rebuild classic cars — I’ve completed full restomods on a ’69 Bronco and a ’69 F100, and I’m planning a Coyote-swapped ’69 Mustang Fastback as my retirement project.  Here is a link to my 1969 Ford Bronco videos: https://www.youtube.com/@FordBronco-tf8zv.
