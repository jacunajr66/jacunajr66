## 🧠 About Me

I am a seasoned IT consultant with over 30 years of experience in software development, solution architecture, and enterprise integrations, especially in merchandise planning. I’ve led cross-functional teams and delivered scalable solutions across retail, grocery, and fashion. These days, I’m focused on data engineering with Python, and expanding into cloud platforms like Azure and Snowflake. I specialize in turning complex challenges into clean, efficient systems — whether building from scratch or optimizing what’s already there.

Fun fact: In my spare time, I rebuild classic cars — I’ve completed full restomods on a ’69 Bronco and an ’69 F100, and I’m planning a Coyote-swapped ’69 Mustang Fastback as my retirement project.
